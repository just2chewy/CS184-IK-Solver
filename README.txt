Compile + Running Instructions:
- The files should be compiled using "make -f makefile.cygwin", which will produce an executable called ik.exe. 
- This executable has to be run with an input file that describes the bones and path
- Look at the example paths submitted (line.txt, eight.txt, circle.txt, 3D.txt) to follow how to create correct input files.
- A general input file is written as:
x_translate_value y_translate_value z_coordinate_value
type_of_path
path_specific_values
bone_positions bone_colors
